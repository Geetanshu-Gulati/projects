    <h2>Recipie</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel, cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks, and sprinkle with salt.</li>
        <li>Stir mayonnaise, lime zest, ginger, salt, and pepper for the marinade in a bowl until smooth. Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag, add marinade, seal, and massage the bag until all the chicken pieces are coated. Place in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 2 hours, or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Soak 6-inch wooden skewers in a bowl of water for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, ginger, and sambal oelek together in a bowl. Slowly whisk in small amounts of warm water until dipping sauce reaches the desired consistency; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the grill to medium-high and oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and thread chicken onto the skewers; discard marinade.</li>
        <li>Place skewers on the hot grill and cook until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear, 10 to 12 minutes, lowering the heat if chicken is browning too fast. Turn skewers as often as necessary for even browning, and to keep the chicken from burning.</li>
        <li>Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve with fresh lime wedges and peanut sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
